# Mailer

New module i built to replace nodemailer, typing is hard...

So, in this stuff 


```javascript
	const mailer= require("mailer");

	var m= new mailer("Gmail username","Gmail password")
	m.send("Email Address of receiver","Subject","HTML Body")
```

> Turn on less secure apps on gmail to get password
